# Spam-Email-Detection
The learning objective of this model is to develop a better understanding of different machine learning algorithms and be able to identify the best suited algorithm for the defined purpose. Moreover, it also includes to learn to implement the algorithm to design the appropriate system.The prime outcome objective of the project is to design a system that would correctly identify the spam e-mails.
To run this project we use Spyder Anaconda IDE
